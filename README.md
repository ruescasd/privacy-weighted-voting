# privacy-weighted-voting
This repository contains code for the following post series on degree of privacy and weighted voting:

1. [Degree of privacy in voting](https://nvotes.com/degree-privacy-voting/)
2. [A privacy attack on weighted voting](https://nvotes.com/privacy-attack-weighted-voting/)
3. [Degree of privacy for weighted voting](https://nvotes.com/degree-privacy-weighted-voting/)

The following is included, under the [src/main](src/main) directory:

* [Latte Integrale](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software.php) h-representation definitions for election polytopes. The [attacks.hrep.latte](src/main/latte/attacks.hrep.latte) contains the attacks described in post #2.
* Shell script to invoke Latte for counting in and integrating (ehrhart polynomials) over election polytopes. Used in post #2.
* [Polymake](https://polymake.org/) perl scripts to define and list lattice points in the feasible region of election polytopes. Used in post #3.
* Scala [code](src/main/scala/D2.scala) for the degree of privacy and probability calculations in post #3, using lattice point listings generated by polymake and [ppl](http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/) as input.
* [Cplex LP](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/CPLEX-format.htm) integer program definitions for election polytopes. Can be used as an alternative to polymake.
